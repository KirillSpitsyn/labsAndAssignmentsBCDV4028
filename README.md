Assignment 1.
My deployment wallet address on Sepolia: 0xa4D9a34F699c37A504773816Fce6A96a24aca564
My deployment wallet address on Ganache: 0x82eb03b49FC1E1444089aAe7617AEB8dDc378bD9

Assignment 1 Testing Bridge Contract. Files can be found in testAssignment1 folder inside BCDV4028 Assignment 1 folder. I created 2 
different tokens to test the contract, and I tested functionality for receiving tokens to the bridge smart contract and sending tokens
from the bridge smart contract. Also, I tested that the initial values during contract deployment were set correctly.

Assignment 1. Screenshots demonstrating token transfers from Ganache Local Network to Sepolia Network. For this process, I 
created 200 tokens on each network, and transferred 20 TTA tokens from Ganache local network to Sepolia network using the bridge contracts
on both networks. Bridge contract receives tokens from the sender, locks them, and then script get the Transfer signal for minting tokens
on another network using a smart contract for creating tokens on another network, and then bridge on another network receives transferred 
tokens and send them to the destination address.
